# Codex Pacer v1.0.1

## Summary

`v1.0.1` updates Codex Pacer for GPT-5.5 usage accounting and documents the current signed DMG release workflow.

This is a focused maintenance release for users who want API-equivalent value estimates to stay accurate as Codex model usage moves to GPT-5.5.

## Highlights

- refreshed API-equivalent value around OpenAI Standard short-context text-token pricing
- removed Codex fast-mode multipliers from API-equivalent value calculations
- updated session import, recalculation, turn timelines, and token-composition breakdowns to use the same short-context API pricing formula
- clarified that API-equivalent value is a comparison metric, not a Codex credit or billing reproduction
- updated packaging docs to explain why GitHub Releases is the canonical distribution point for versioned installers

## Packaging

Packaged asset at this release:

- signed and notarized macOS Apple Silicon DMG via GitHub Releases

GitHub Releases is used as the public release boundary for this project: each release is tied to a Git tag, carries the user-facing release notes, and hosts packaged assets plus checksums users should install from.

## Notes

- `v1.0.1` was the previous stable release line. See the latest release notes for the current stable version.
- Intel macOS, universal builds, Linux bundles, Windows code signing, and auto-update delivery are not currently promised as official release assets.
- Current Windows installer support is documented in the latest installation and release docs.
- Codex Pacer remains local-first and does not depend on a cloud sync service to work.
